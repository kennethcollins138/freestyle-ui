Simplify Component Manager
    - Break down into manager and render
    - Integrate Redis again


Add workflow

user clicks add form => add form appears setting state to add form on click and component type.
                                                                            ||
                                                                            ||
 component-specific form is added <= rerender triggers on original page triggering form
    ||
    ||
 form handles redis caching and data storage.
    ||
    ||
 States are reset
    ||
rinse and repeat



Edit Workflow


user clicks edit form => edit form previews with all new components(make this handle reorder and specific update) => dive into later
