NEXT STEPS:
- Add Back Edit and Delete
- Trigger rerender after any of these forms so user doesnt have to refresh page
- Pagination Button

Add workflow

user clicks add form => add form appears setting state to add form on click and component type.
                                                                            ||
                                                                            ||
 component-specific form is added <= rerender triggers on original page triggering form
    ||
    ||
 form handles redis caching and data storage.
    ||
    ||
 States are reset
    ||
rinse and repeat
