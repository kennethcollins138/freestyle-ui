# Freestyle UI

Freestyle UI empowers moderators and post owners to design their own custom experiences. This code-free platform allows users to creatively build anything they can imagine!

## App Features

- **Lego-Style Building**
  - Piece components together to bring your vision to life.
  - Read the [documentation](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/blocks/overview) to understand what each piece does.
  
- **Super Intuitive UI**
  - Want to edit post settings? Click the settings button!
  - Want to add an image? Hit the plus icon and add the image URL!
  - Want to stack elements horizontally, like buttons? Use an HStack!

## Inspiration

- [Community Hub](https://developers.reddit.com/apps/community-hub) was a huge inspiration, especially /u/pl00h's app!
- This was my first major TypeScript project, and I could not have done this without the team at Reddit's support and clear documentation.
- This app was inspired by the idea of getting more people into the Devvit community. It’s a fun way to learn the ropes of Devvit while also giving your subreddit a boost!

## Instructions

1. Install the app on a subreddit you moderate.
2. Use the moderator menu action to **Create a Freestyle Hub**.
3. You will see a popup to set the post title.
4. Check your private messages for a link to the post.
5. Follow the instructions before navigating to the main page to start building your custom experience!
6. In upcoming updates, you’ll be able to add buttons that link to other pages within the same experience.
7. Feel free to message any requests or suggestions to /u/TheRepDeveloper. Hope you enjoy!

## Notes for Reddit team (Hopefully not included in final publish)

- I'm assuming there are some super avoidable mistakes, but this is my first time attacking app development and typescript with that.
- I thought it would be cool for moderators to be able to edit their own posts and multiple experiences.
- I loved the popups for external links as I thought that was a great safety feature.
